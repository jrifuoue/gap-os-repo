# GAP OS Custom Repository

Welcome to the **GAP OS Custom Repository**, crafted specifically for my personal distribution, **GAP OS**. This repository provides prebuilt binary packages aimed to simplify package management and speed up installations.

---

## About

This repository was created primarily to serve **GAP OS**, my custom Arch-based distribution. However, it is fully compatible and can be integrated with **any Arch Linux based system**, including vanilla Arch Linux itself.

---

## Features

- Prebuilt binary packages for faster installs  
- Includes popular packages difficult to install or compile from AUR (e.g., `yay-bin`, `paru-bin`, `neofetch-git`)  
- Easy to add to your pacman configuration  
- Regular updates depending on maintenance capacity

---

## Usage

1. Add this repository to your `/etc/pacman.conf`:

   ```ini
   [gap-os-repo]
   SigLevel = Optional TrustAll
   Server = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jrifuoue/gap-os-repo/main/x86_64
2. Update your package list:
   ```ini
    sudo pacman -Sy

3. Install packages as usual:
    ```ini
    sudo pacman -S yay-bin paru-bin neofetch-git

Important Notes

    This repository is maintained by a single developer (me!).

    Package versions might lag behind AUR or official repos due to manual maintenance.

    This repo is intended as a convenience for easier access to specific binaries and may not always have the latest versions.

    If you want the newest versions, consider using AUR or official Arch repos.
